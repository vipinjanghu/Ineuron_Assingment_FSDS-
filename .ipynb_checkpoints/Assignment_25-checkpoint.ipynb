It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory By using next() function we can iterate the output of generator function"

The code inside the function is executed each time the next method of the generator is called. The value of the expression following the yield statement is returned as the result of each next call, until the function raises a StopIteration exception to signal the end of the iteration."

List comprehension are used when a list of results is required, where as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. 4.
