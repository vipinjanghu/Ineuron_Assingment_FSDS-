    "\n",
    "Answer-: With the help of a function we can avoid rewriting the same logic code again and again in a program.We can call a              function multiple times insteed of writing the same logic of code multiple time.We can track a large Python program            easily when it is divided into multiple functions.The main achievement of Python functions is its Reusability."
